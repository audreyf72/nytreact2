This New York Times article search is a React based site that uses the New York Times news API to return actual article results based on the parameters the user selects. Article results include the title, date published, and a link to the article on the New York Times website. Search results can be saved for future reference or for other readers to view. Saved results will include the date saved and can be deleted by anyone who visits the page.
